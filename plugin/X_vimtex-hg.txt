" LaTeX Series Part 4 / Options (i.e.ViMTex's Options)

" Where should I put my VimTeX configuration? In practice, you can just dump everything in your vimrc and be fine. A cleaner setup might be to:

" 1. Use a file in your 'plugin' directory (e.g. 'plugin/tex.vim' or 'plugin/vimtex.vim' the name is your choice) to set all global VimTeX options (those that match g:*).
" 2. Use the file 'ftplugin/tex.vim' for other VimTeX-related configuration that you want to apply only in buffers with the tex filetype (e.g. LaTeX-specific keymaps and text objects).

" Placing global options in plugin/ ensures that (1) these options load
" before VimTeX and (2) do not needlessly load multiple times when editing
" multiple LaTeX files in the same Vim session (see the discussion in
" VimTeX issue #2714 for details);
" while placing things like keymaps in ftplugin ensures these keymaps only
" apply in LaTeX files and donâ€™t interfere with mappings you might have set
" in for other file types.
